      <h2>Elder Fraud</h2>
      <p>As technology and the Internet continue to facilitate everyday tasks, responsibilities and pastimes, the threats of scams and cyberattacks grow as well. Scammers prey on innocent people through the telephone, social media, websites and email
        services looking to steal money or information off of the unsuspecting and vulnerable. As humans become more and more tech savvy with time, with children now effortlessly navigating their way through an iPad before they have even learned to
        read, the older, less technologically-inclined people represent arguably the greatest target for scammers.</p>

      <p> Our parents and grandparents are society’s most susceptible scamming victims because they tend to be the most naive demographic. The elderly are generally lonelier, thus making them more inclined to listen to just about anyone and trust
        strangers more easily (“The Fraud Examiner”). Some other characteristics that make the elderly more vulnerable to fraud include lowered cognitive skills due to old age and financial security (“Top Internet Scams Affecting The Elderly”).</p>

      <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation estimates that the elderly population of the United States loses over $3 billion every year through various scams (“Elder Fraud”). Some less conservative estimates have that figure much higher, with the
        Orlando Sentinel reporting that the median amount a person over 80 years old loses a year was over $1,000, while those between 70 and 79 lose over $600 a year (“Top Internet Scams Affecting The Elderly”). </p>

      <p>Scammers continue to get more and more creative, finding new ways to fool and exploit the elderly on the Internet and through their various devices. Some scams pretend to be a financial institution requesting a payment by email, while others
        can pretend to be a relative asking for money on Facebook.</p>

      <p> One of the most common scamming practices involves medicare. In these cases, fraudsters would act as a medical service or company that the victim may be familiar with, asking them to confirm their personal information, which is then used by
        scammers to exploit medical insurance systems and wrongfully claim money (“The Fraud Examiner”).</p>

      <p>Another popular scam, and perhaps one of the most immoral kinds, is what’s known as “the grandparent scam”, in which a scammer places a call or message to an elderly person and pretends to be one of their grandchildren (“Top 10 Financial
        Scams Targeting Seniors”). The scammers proceed to request money for a financial problem, like overdue rent or grocery money, and ask the victim to not tell any other family members about the “embarrassing” request (“Top 10 Financial Scams
        Targeting Seniors”).</p>

      <p>Similar to the grandparent scam, some seniors are also susceptible to what is known as a “sweetheart” or “romance” scam. Elderly men and women, especially those who live alone or have recently lost their partner, are targeted by scammers who
        develop a fake online relationship with the victim, endearing themselves to the victim and eventually asking for money to help with financial problems (“Top Internet Scams Affecting the Elderly”).</p>

      <p> With more and more business being done online, whether it be shopping or banking, there is more risk to navigating the Internet on a daily basis, with scammers masquerading as people’s trusted institutions and corporations. This form of
        scam is popularly known as “phishing”, which the Federal Trade Commission defines as “a type of online scam that targets consumers by sending them an e-mail that appears to be from a well-known source – an internet service provider, a bank,
        or a mortgage company, for example.” (“Phishing Scams”). The victim is asked to provide personal information, like passwords or credit card numbers, which are then used by a scammer to commit fraud and spend the victim’s money (“Phishing
        Scams”).</p>

      <p>Virtually everyone that has an e-mail address will by now be used to seeing an excessive amount of messages in their junk folder advertising that they have won a free cruise or that they are eligible to receive $10,000 suddenly. Those who
        are well accustomed to the Internet and its many perils will know not to engage with these obviously fraudulent e-mails, but for those who have limited experience and understanding of the technological world, like the elderly, are easy
        targets for this kind of scam. In this case, fraudsters inform the victims, usually via e-mail, that they have won some sort of prize, like an all-expenses paid trip to the Bahamas or a free Apple MacBook. Before they can redeem their grand
        prize, the victim must first pay a fee, which is how the scammers make their money (“Top 10 Financial Scams Targeting Seniors”). In the case of the supposed prize being cash, the victim receives a check, which they successfully cash into
        their bank account. But within a matter of days, the fake check bounces, the money is lost and the victim is left with a deficit of however much they paid in “fees” for their phoney prize (“Top 10 Financial Scams Targeting Seniors”).

        This website will aim to educate older adults on how to navigate the web and spot scams. It will present the information in a clear and easy-to-understand way, using sizes, colours and shapes that are specifically catered to this demographic.
        For example, toptal.com says to avoid using shades of blue when designing for the elderly, as this colour may appear faded to those with impaired vision (Polyuk).
        The guide also suggests using large typography and buttons, and high contast colours to make elements easily legible (Polyuk). Some other suggestions include labelling icons with their function, e.g. writing "home" underneath an icon of a
        house, to ensure clarity (Polyuk).
